# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

//I have try to create cryptocurreny using erc20 token
// written some test on the and deployed the contract on the goerli testnet through infura

this is my contract address :0x087F27DB3c7Da54D2E07bE319AB3f2b847094582
